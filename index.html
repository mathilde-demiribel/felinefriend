 	  <h2>Why cats are better than every others animals.</h2>
 	  <p>
 	  	The relationship between humans and cats is unique, marked by mutual independence and companionship. Unlike dogs, cats chose to live alongside humans, controlling pests and benefiting from our warmth and food. This coexistence has evolved into a bond where cats teach us patience, attentiveness, and the value of boundaries. Studies suggest cats reduce stress and create a calming environment, making them ideal companions for independent spirits. In sharing our lives with cats, we often gain insight into ourselves as well.
